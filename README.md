# Rusty Donut :doughnut:	

“Rusty Donut :doughnut:	” is a console program in Rust that generates a rotating donut on the terminal, combining art, mathematics, and programming in a fun way.

## Overview

The Rusty Donut program creates a visually engaging representation of a toroidal shape (a donut) by calculating points in 3D space and projecting them onto a 2D plane. This project serves as an excellent example of how mathematics can be applied in programming to create artistic visuals.

## How It Works

The donut is rendered using ASCII characters, with mathematical calculations based on trigonometric functions to determine the coordinates of points on the surface of the torus. The program employs techniques such as z-buffering to manage depth and visibility, ensuring a smooth and realistic rotation effect.

## Getting Started

To run the Rusty Donut program, follow these steps:
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine.
Compile and run the program using Cargo.
